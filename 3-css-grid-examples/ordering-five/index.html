      <h1>Takeaway: Be careful with ordering and be specific if you can</h1>
      <h1>Grid 1: Whitespace</h1>
      <p>
        Notice that item d can fit in row 2 col 1, OR row 1 col 3, but it gets
        displayed after item c. I am PRETTY SURE it's because by default, if
        they can, elements will wait until after the element before them in the
        dom shows up. "d" is after "c", and "d" isn't told where to go, so it
        will leave white space present, and show up after "c".
      </p>
      <div class="grid container">
        <div class="a">item a</div>
        <div class="b">item b</div>
        <div class="c">item c</div>
        <div class="d">item d</div>
        <div class="e">item e</div>
        <div class="f">item f</div>
      </div>

      <h1>Grid 2: Moving things backwards in the grid</h1>
      <p>
        item a was able to move behind everything and all the other elements
        moved in front of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >The new theory is that elements can be told to move BEHIND elements
          that come after, but otherwise elements will wait their turn to show,
          leaving white space</strong
        >
        So item "c", and item "d" are able to go in front of item "a" because
        item "a" was explicitly placed "backwards" in the dom.. behind other
        elements that it should have gone in front of.
      </p>
      <p>
        But item F is only told to span two columns, it's not explicitly placed
        behind g and h, so g and h have to show up after f.
      </p>
      <div class="grid2 container">
        <div class="a2">item a</div>
        <div class="b2">item b</div>
        <div class="c2">item c</div>
        <div class="d2">item d</div>
        <div class="e2">item e</div>
        <div class="f2">item f</div>
        <div class="g2">item g</div>
        <div class="h2">item h</div>
      </div>

      <h1>Grid 3</h1>
      <p>Just guessing with how this is working. But:</p>
      <p>
        b is specifically told to start on row 1. It WOULD go after "item a" if
        it could, but "item c" prevents that from happening because "item c" is
        told to be at row 2, column 2, which is where "item b" would extend
        into. So.. grid item positioning has some kind of specificity rules,
        where overlapping is last resort.
      </p>
      <div class="grid3 container">
        <div class="a3">item a</div>
        <div class="b3">item b</div>
        <div class="c3">item c</div>
        <div class="d3">item d</div>
        <div class="e3">item e</div>
        <div class="f3">item f</div>
        <div class="g3">item g</div>
        <div class="h3">item h</div>
      </div>

      <h1>Grid 4</h1>
      <p>Just guessing with how this is working. But:</p>
      <p>
        Telling a grid row to start and end at a specific spot must be
        "stronger" in the specificity ruleset than giving a less specific
        instruction of "span two rows" because in this scenario, "item b" does
        essentially the same thing, but finds its resting spot on the 3rd column
        of row 1. I don't see why the previous example couldn't have done this
        too.
      </p>
      <div class="grid4 container">
        <div class="a4">item a</div>
        <div class="b4">item b</div>
        <div class="c4">item c</div>
        <div class="d4">item d</div>
        <div class="e4">item e</div>
        <div class="f4">item f</div>
        <div class="g4">item g</div>
        <div class="h4">item h</div>
      </div>

      <h1>Grid 5</h1>
      <p>Just guessing with how this is working. But:</p>
      <p>
        item "a" goes first, it's top of the dom AND given a specific
        instruction to be in the first row. item "b" is also told to go on the
        first row, and end at row line 3, and cannot do that without overlapping
        c, so moves to column 3. item "c" is specifically located behind where
        "item d" would go at this point, so "item d" is allowed to move forward
        and fill the whitespace.
      </p>

      <div class="grid5 container">
        <div class="a5">item a</div>
        <div class="b5">item b</div>
        <div class="c5">item c</div>
        <div class="d5">item d</div>
        <div class="e5">item e</div>
        <div class="f5">item f</div>
        <div class="g5">item g</div>
        <div class="h5">item h</div>
